AEMET
    `AEMET` (Agencia Estatal de Meteorología) is the _Spanish State Meteorological Agency_.
    It is the public body responsible for the development, implementation, and provision of meteorological
    and climatological services in Spain. It publishes official weather forecasts, warnings, and climate data
    through its website and open data services, including XML feeds per municipality.

Plone
    [Plone](https://plone.org/) is an open-source content management system that is used to create, edit, and
    manage digital content, like websites, intranets and custom solutions. It comes with over 20 years of growth,
    optimisations, and refinements. The result is a system trusted by governments, universities, businesses, and
    other organisations all over the world.

    ```{tip}
    Plone` acts as the backend intermediary between the {term}`AEMET` service data and the {term}`Volto` frontend.
    ```

Volto
    [Volto](https://github.com/plone/volto) is the default React-based frontend for {term}`Plone` 6.
    It communicates with the {term}`Plone` backend via exclusively through the {term}`plone.restapi` REST API.
    The {term}`volto-aemet` {term}`add-on` integrates {term}`AEMET` some features into {term}`Volto` pages.

add-on
    An add-on in {term}`Plone` extends its core functionality.
    It is distributed as a Python package and installed via the {term}`Plone` Site Setup.
    {term}`collective.volto.aemet` is a {term}`Plone` add-on.

    Its companion {term}`volto-aemet` is a {term}`Volto` (JavaScript) add-on.

    In {term}`Volto`, an add-on is a JavaScript package.

    In {term}`Plone` core, an add-on is a Python package.

plone.restapi
    `plone.restapi` is the RESTful hypermedia API for {term}`Plone`. It enables {term}`Volto` and other clients
    to interact with {term}`Plone` content and configuration over HTTP using JSON. This {term}`add-on` registers
    its services and {term}`Control panel` adapters through ``plone.restapi``. It is used by {term}`collective.volto.aemet`
    to expose the {term}`@aemet-settings` and {term}`@aemet-weather-forecast` endpoints to the {term}`Volto` frontend.

    ```{tip}

    ```

Control panel
    Checkout the {term}`AEMET Settings` term.

AEMET Settings
    The `AEMET Settings` {term}`Control panel` available in {term}`Plone`'s Site Setup under `Add-on Configuration`.
    It allows administrators to configure the {term}`Location ID` field stored in {term}`plone.registry`.

plone.registry
    A {term}`Plone` component that stores configuration values as named records.
    {term}`collective.volto.aemet` uses it to persist the {term}`IAemetSettings` interface field ({term}`location_id`).

Registry
    The {term}`Plone` Registry is a key-value store for site configuration, managed by the {term}`plone.registry` package.
    Settings are declared through Zope schema interfaces and stored as typed records.
    In this {term}`add-on` the records are declared in {term}`IAemetSettings` and stored under the ``aemet`` prefix (e.g. ``aemet.location_id``).
    They can be read using ``plone.api.portal.get_registry_record("aemet.location_id")``.

GenericSetup
    A {term}`Plone` framework for managing configuration through filesystem-based import and export profiles.
    {term}`collective.volto.aemet` uses a `GenericSetup` profile to register its registry records and {term}`Control panel` on installation.

collective.volto.aemet
    `collective.volto.aemet` is the {term}`Plone` {term}`add-on` that integrates {term}`AEMET` sevice weather data into a {term}`Plone` site.
    It provides a {term}`Control panel` to configure the target municipality, a REST API endpoint to expose weather forecast data, and a
    browser layer ({term}`IAemetLayer`) to scope its components.
    It is designed to work together with the {term}`volto-aemet` {term}`Volto` {term}`add-on`.

    ```{tip}
    More infomation checkout the official [documentation](https://collectivevoltoaemet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
    ```

volto-aemet
    `volto-aemet` is the {term}`Volto` {term}`add-on` that integrates {term}`AEMET` sevice weather data into a {term}`Plone` site via
    the {term}`collective.volto.aemet` {term}`add-on`.
    It provides a {term}`Control panel` to configure the target municipality, Two Volto content blocks.

    ```{tip}
    More infomation checkout the official [documentation](https://volto-aemet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
    ```

IAemetLayer
    ``IAemetLayer`` is a browser layer marker interface provided by this {term}`add-on`.
    It is applied to the request when the {term}`add-on` is installed, scoping all views, services, and adapters to sites where the {term}`add-on` is active.

IAemetSettings
    ``IAemetSettings`` is the Zope schema interface that declares the configuration fields for the {term}`AEMET` {term}`add-on`.
    Currently it defines a single field: {term}`location_id`.
    It is used as the schema for both the {term}`AEMET Settings` {term}`Control panel` and the {term}`Plone` {term}`Registry` records.

Location ID
location_id
    The Location ID is a numeric code that uniquely identifies a Spanish municipality in the {term}`AEMET` service in `XML` data.
    It is used to construct the URL of the XML feed, for example:
    ``https://www.aemet.es/xml/municipios/localidad_28058.xml`` for Madrid (``28058``),
    or ``localidad_41091.xml`` for Sevilla (``41091``).
    It is configured via the {term}`AEMET Settings` {term}`Control panel` and stored in the {term}`Plone` registry under the key ``aemet.location_id``.

@aemet-settings
    A REST API endpoint exposed by {term}`collective.volto.aemet` that provides the {term}`AEMET Settings` to the {term}`Volto` frontend.
    Anonymous users cannot access the {term}`Plone` registry directly, so this dedicated endpoint is used instead.

    ```{note}
    Take a look to the {ref}`aemet-settings-route` section.
    ```

@aemet-weather-forecast
    A REST API endpoint exposed by {term}`collective.volto.aemet` {term}`add-on` that allows {term}`Volto` to get the weather data.
    It is publicly accessible (``zope2.View`` permission) and returns a JSON object with the current day's weather forecast for the
    configured municipality, fetched from the {term}`AEMET` service in `XML` format.

    ```{note}
    Take a look to the {ref}`aemet-weather-forecast-route` section.
    ```
